# Week 6  - Puppet Hand

This week we built the puppet hands and then made bending sensors and tried to control the sound using them.
1. After making the puppet hand, we built the circuit and soldered it.
2. We connected the circuit to the arduino.
3. We uploded the code to the arduino. The code uses tone function which generates a square wave of the specified frequency. In the code we take the sensor values from the bending fingers and map them between 120-1500 frequencies.
4. We tested the code with one finger.

5. We tried the finger sensors with our hand before putting them on to the puppet hand.

6. We put the finger sensors on the puppet hand.

(Week8-Lab4) Reflections from Building the Hand
Puppet hand lab was an interesting embodiment experiment. First, we tried the bending sensors with our hands and then tried to control them using the puppet hand, controlling them using our fingers was easier than using the puppet hand. Trying to control sound using an extended hand was harder because it was a different motion trying to bend a cardboard finger than bending our fingers. However, this experience may change if we get used to using the puppet hand. Using an extended hand was a great exercise for merging the body and tools. It was harder to control but it felt more powerful than using my fingers. Usually, when we use our body we donâ€™t think about our motions but when I tried to bend cardboard fingers it felt much harder because I had to think about the motions of my fingers and their consequences. Even though I was controlling it, as it is harder to control I felt it has its own mind.
