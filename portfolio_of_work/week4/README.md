Idea: We can create a music instrument with a capacitive sensor. The interface can be anything which is conductive. Like water, plants. 
</br>
I tried to crate a water touch sensor usinf a capacitive touch sensor. I connected the MPR121 to foil and put the foil into the water. When we touch the water the values for the 4. pin changes. It can be seen in the serial monitor screen recording.
