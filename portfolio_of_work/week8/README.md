# Week8 - Analog Synths & Soft bots

## Lab: Simple synths

We built an analog synth using a CD40106BE chip, a capacitor, a potentiometer, and speakers. The chip is a hex schmitt trigger. Analog synthesizers generate sounds by manipulating electric voltages. The oscillator shapes the voltage to produce a pitch at a given frequency, which constructs the waveform. The oscillator can be controlled by a tool on the synthesizer's interface (a potentiometer in our case).  The sound passes to the amplifier, which controls the volume of the sound. In our example, we changed the capacitors which changed the pitch and created different sounds. The faster a capacitor charges, it produces a higher pitch. We also used a potentiometer to control the pitch of the sound.

The first test was problematic because of a connection problem, wherever we touch on the circuit it made different sound. I guess it may be because the chip wasnâ€™t fully connected  to the breadboard.

</br>
After solving the connection problem we tried using 10 uF capacitor which made a higher pitch and changed the potentiometer values to change the sound.

Then we tried the 470 uF capacitor which made a slower pitch and changed the potentiometer values to change the sound.
